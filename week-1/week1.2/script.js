// intrepeted language-> javascript
// run line by line
//compile language-> C++
console.log("hello world");
// interpreted language can partially run until error comes
console.log(a);

// JS-> Dynamic language - can be changed[data type] -- might bring run time error, thats why typescript is used to make js more static

// C++-> Static language - can't be changed

// JS-> Single threaded language -> synchronous -> run line by line -> bad lang for scalable systems -> use one core of cpu at a time
// JS -> can be multi threaded -> there is a way

// Multi threaded language -> asynchronous
